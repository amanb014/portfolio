Watching youtube playlists right from your desktop, keep track of time-data, mark videos watched (auto), and resume partially watched videos.\n\nFor example, when you start watching a sequential playlist with episodes (ep. 1, 2, 3 â€¦), and stop at episode 4, after watching six minutes, would you remember it? Do you rely on the YouTube history? Simply add your playlist to this application and start watching. When you finish the first video, the next video in the YouTube playlist is automatically loaded. Resume watching, and the last position in the last video is loaded automatically!\n\n[View Source on GitHub](https://github.com/amanb014/viewtube/tree/ng4-rewrite/ng4-rewrite){:target=\"_blank\"}","objects":{"entry":{"path":"content/projects/viewtube.md","sha":"cb1e45777325f7272b97da1c3220ceffe4a0f70b"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2019-03-24T21:16:33.931Z","status":"pending_publish"}
