The code is written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.\n\n## About\n\nHow to play: The game involves two players, and each player gets one (1) move per turn. In each turn, a player must choose a column to drop their piece. The pieces fall down (because of pseudo-gravity) and go to the bottom most space available. Player 1 is red, Player 2 is black. Each playerâ€™s goal is to create a sequence of four (4) pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. There are three outcomes of the game: player 1 wins, player 2 wins, draw.\n\n\n## Controls of the Game:\n  - Players can click on the column to drop their piece (or touch)\n  - Players can use the arrow keys to move through columns and space to drop on their physical keyboard (given they have one)\n  - Players can use A and D to move through columns and space to drop on their physical keyboard.\n  - Players can enable on-screen left, right, and drop keys and press the buttons.\n\n---\n\nEach player gets to enter their name for pseudo-points assigned to their name. Currently, no scores are stored anywhere to prove your victories.\n\nThank you for reading, enjoy!","objects":{"entry":{"path":"content/projects/connect-4.md","sha":"bbcabac7013ff3829f8e34edf1820f6c157561c0"},"files":[{"path":"/static/images/connect1.png","sha":"147c7b9cbd621aa156a2ed2c53e91e34e79fdf21"}]},"timeStamp":"2019-03-20T02:24:23.719Z","status":"pending_publish"}
