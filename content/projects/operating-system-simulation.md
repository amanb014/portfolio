description: >-
  This project accomplished a simulation of the Operating System - including
  CPU, Disk, RAM, Driver, Loader, Pager, and Schedulers. Disk was responsible
  for storing items, Short-Term and Long-Term schedulers were responsible for
  scheduling tasks, Pager was responsible for placing required pages of data
  into memory (RAM) from Disk, which are stored and tracked on the Page Table.


  Provided a finite amount of tasks to finish, and limited memory, tasks have to
  be loaded based on a priority-queue, and placed into memory as needed.
