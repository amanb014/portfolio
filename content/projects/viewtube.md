  ViewTube is an application created to manage YouTube playlists easily from
  your desktop. Watching youtube playlists right from your desktop, keep track
  of time-data, mark videos watched (auto), and resume partially watched videos.


  For example, when you start watching a sequential playlist with episodes (ep.
  1, 2, 3 â€¦), and stop at episode 4, after watching six minutes, would you
  remember it? Do you rely on the YouTube history? Simply add your playlist to
  this application and start watching. When you finish the first video, the next
  video in the YouTube playlist is automatically loaded. Resume watching, and
  the last position in the last video is loaded automatically!
