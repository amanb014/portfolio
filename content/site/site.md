  I believe that personality matters more when you spend 8 hours a day working
  alongside someone. This personality is made up of what you are outside of your
  office or business. Getting to know someone, team bonding, and considering
  their values goes a long way to make an efficient team.


  Below are some of the ways you can get to know me. If you would like to
  comment on any of these - please feel free to reach out and have a chat
