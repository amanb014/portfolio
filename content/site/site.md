  I believe that personality matters more when you spend 8 hours a day working
  alongside someone. This personality is made up of what you are outside of your
  office or business. Getting to know someone, team bonding, and considering
  their values goes a long way to make an efficient team.


  Below are some of the ways you can get to know me. If you would like to
  comment on any of these - please feel free to reach out and have a chat
  (button at the top right)!

  My passion is to bring my work to life - in the last 5 years, I have found
  full-stack development to be the perfect tool to complete this job. What does
  this mean? I can write front-end and back-end code for your websites and bring
  them to life. I have large experience with Angular 2+, and React enterprise
  applications. On the back-end, using Node.js to interact with databases, APIs,
  proxies, and file-system interactions.


  I personally also designed and wrote this website you are looking at - to
  display some of my other work.
