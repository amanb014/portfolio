{"type":"PR","pr":{"number":11,"head":"6e990d19bf6eb9590987df1566e1a5d8957a76e9"},"user":"Aman Bhimani","status":"draft","branch":"cms/minesweeper","collection":"project","title":"Minesweeper","description":"This is a personal project I have worked on in my spare time for fun. Minesweeper is a perfect game to work on in JavaScript.\n\nThe motivation of this project was to learn more about object oriented programming in JavaScript. The main component (library) used was p5.js. This library helps you with regular game development functions such as setup() and draw(). Along with p5.js, I also used objects such as “cell” and “grid” to for management.\n\n## Features\n  - Variable sized grids\n  - Different number of mines per play\n  - Restart game without refresh\n  - Score tally\n  - Particles (on/off) upon losing\n\nThe live demo can be found at the following link with the latest updates from GitHub. It is fully playable in a desktop environment. The only thing missing from the mobile environment will be the right-click option for flagging mines – that is a future feature to be implemented.\n","objects":{"entry":{"path":"content/projects/minesweeper.md","sha":"bda71ba3cf41415647b223244d61f11e1a95525d"},"files":[{"path":"/static/images/minesweeper1.png","sha":"1e7272014051705b9e7aecd42fa51480f0b24a16"},{"path":"/static/images/minesweeper2.png","sha":"72dc0e86992f1dc658c53dae6f0b8984e86f6007"},{"path":"/static/images/minesweeper3.png","sha":"3ca5ee0e4c2e404e31ef19ccd4e259bfa283f20b"}]},"timeStamp":"2019-03-20T02:20:22.210Z"}
